👋 Hi, I’m @Narandan  

🧠 I’m a Computer Science student focused on building strong fundamentals in systems programming, data structures, and algorithms.  

⚙️ My primary language is C++, and I enjoy working close to the metal—understanding performance, memory behavior, and correctness from first principles. I also use Python when it’s the right tool.  

🔬 I’m currently deepening my understanding of core CS topics by rebuilding data structures, exploring low-level behavior, and instrumenting code to study real tradeoffs.  

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on projects that emphasize learning, correctness, and thoughtful engineering over flash.
